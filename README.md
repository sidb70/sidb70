# Hello!

I'm <u>Siddhartha Bhattacharya</u>. I'm currently conducting research in topics in **AI/ML** related to **Decentralized Federated Learning** and **Computer Vision**. I am passionate about creating intelligence that is _secure, robust,_ and _equitable_.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Byzantine-Secure Decentralized Federated Learning**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **computer vision for robotic systems, distributed systems**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creating _ML/AI_ systems that are secure and are _scalable_.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have never centered a `<div>`.
