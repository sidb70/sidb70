# Hello!

I'm <u>Siddhartha Bhattacharya</u>. I'm currently doing machine learning research in to **Graph Learning, Computer Vision, and Federated Learning**. I am passionate about creating intelligence that is _secure, scalable to large models,_ and _equitable_.

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **[antilect: understanding the internal representations of large models](https://github.com/sidb70/gmn)**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about **graph neural networks, and representation learning**.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have never centered a `<div>`.

## Projects

Here are some projects I'm proud of:

- [Byzantine-Secure Decentralized Federated Learning](https://github.com/sidb70/DFL-Secure-Aggregation)
- [Fed Up: A Decentralized Federated Learning Platform](https://github.com/sidb70/SpartaHackFed)
